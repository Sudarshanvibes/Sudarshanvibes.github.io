    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m Sudarshan, a final-year Mechanical Engineering student passionate about design, manufacturing, and automation. I thrive at the intersection of mechanical systems and modern technology â€” from CAD design to FEA simulations and hands-on prototyping.</p>
    <p>Currently, Iâ€™m working on projects that connect mechanical engineering with coding to create smart, efficient solutions. I enjoy tackling real-world problems, exploring new tools, and building skills that help me grow as an engineer and team player.</p>
    <p>My goal is to contribute to innovative teams in the automotive, manufacturing, or automation sectors â€” while continuously learning and pushing myself to do better every day.</p>
